# Favorite Fonts

Google Fonts lacks a ‘favorites’ feature, which makes it challenging to keep track of the amazing fonts I discover. Simply bookmarking them felt inadequate, so I decided to create an app that allows me to easily view and manage all the cool fonts I want to save for future use.

Try it out here: https://cassianebel.github.io/favorite-fonts/

## Features
- Effortlessly add any Google Font to your favorites list by simply typing its name.
- Your favorites list is stored locally, so it’s always just a click away.
- Seamlessly toggle between light and dark modes, no matter where you are on the page.
- Customize the sample text to preview how each font looks with your own words.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to get the app up and running on your local machine:

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git```
2. Navigate to the project’s root directory:
```cd your-repo-name```
3. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
```npm install```
4. Start the Development Server:
```npm run dev```
